The information content of the HP-MRI data is fundamentally limited by the physics and chemistry of specific processes that take place at an atomic scale during a well-defined chemical reaction. The HP signal (magnetization of pyruvate and lactate) is a fixed resource that is established at the polarizer and naturally decays over time, and cannot be renewed after injection. The signal is further reduced with every radio-frequency excitation by the MR pulse sequence. Therefore, optimal experimental design (OED) for data acquisition is fundamentally important. A key parameter of interest recovered from HP-MRI measurements is the apparent pyruvate-to-lactate exchange rate, kPL, for measuring tumor metabolism. This manuscript presents an information-theory-based OED approach that minimizes the uncertainty in the rate parameter, kPL, recovered from the HP-MRI measurements.\n\nResults suggest that the mutual information-based optimal data acquisition strategy is likely to improve the precision of the measurements. For the particular MRI data examined here, pyruvate and lactate flip angles of 35 and 28 degrees, respectively, were the best choice in terms of accuracy and precision of the parameter recovery. Moreover, the recovery of rate parameter kPL from the data generated from the high-fidelity model highlights the influence of diffusion and strength of vascular source on the recovered rate parameter. Since the existing pharmacokinetic models for HP-MRI do not account for spatial variation, the optimized design parameters may not be fully optimal in a more general 3D setting.","tags":null,"title":"Mutual-Information Based Optimal Experimental Design for Hyperpolarized 13C-Pyruvate MRI","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Prashant K Jha","J.

The main ingredient in the proposed model calibration scheme are goal-oriented a-posteriori estimates of error in QoIs computed using a so-called lower fidelity model compared to those of an uncalibrated higher fidelity model. The estimates of error in QoIs are used to define likelihood functions in Bayesian inversion analysis. A standard Bayesian approach is employed to compute the posterior distribution of model parameters of high-fidelity models. As applications, parameters in a quasi-linear second-order elliptic boundary-value problem (BVP) are calibrated using a second-order linear elliptic BVP.

In HP MRI, MR visible HP pyruvate is injected into the patient. It is observed that the cancerous cells promote higher production of lactate from pyruvate through Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) compared to healthy cells; since the pyruvate is polarized, the product lactate is also polarized and visible in the MR scan. Therefore, the HP MRI experiment allows one to see HP pyruvate's distribution and the byproduct such as lactate. Higher conversion of pyruvate to lactate in the tissue may indicate the presence of an active tumor colony. Hence, the pyruvate-to-lactate conversion rate is a parameter of interest and must be inferred from the HP MR scan data. Mathematical models are required to recover the pyruvate-to-lactate conversion rate; the model needs to account for the natural decay of polarization in pyruvate and lactate, loss of polarization due to the interaction of MR signal and polarization, transient nature of vascular input of polarized pyruvate, and also the presence of endogenous pyruvate and lactate in the tissue. Additionally, the parameter's inference should also account for the signal-to-noise ratio and other uncertainties such as bolus arrival time. Unlike traditional MR, where the source does not change as many times the scan is taken, in HP MRI, there is polarization loss in every scan. This loss depends on the choice of flip angles and repetition times. There are two significant challenges associated with the HP MR experiment: 1) selecting the most plausible model among multiple models for the given data, 2) optimizing MR parameters such as repetition times and flip angles for the most accurate inference of pyruvate-to-lactate conversion rate. In this work, we apply the OPAL (the Occam Plausibility Algorithm) model selection method to find the most plausible model for the given data. For the second challenge, we consider the Bayesian-based optimal experimental design (OED); here, we formulate the mutual information for the design parameters taking the total signal as the data and ask for design parameters that maximize the mutual information. Our results show that the optimal parameters such as repetition time and flip angles are different from what is considered typically in the experiments. We also show that with optimal design parameters, the variation in pyruvate-to-lactate conversion rate is smaller. Future works include developing high-fidelity spatially varying models with explicit vessel-tissue flow coupling and the formulation of optimal experimental design using high-fidelity models.","tags":null,"title":"Model selection and optimal experiment design for HP MRI experiments","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"With colleagues, Ernesto Lima and Chengyue Wu, at Oden Institute, we are organizing a virtual thematic conference on computational oncology.

I found the process to be overall simple and straightforward. The process of setting up a new website includes:\n selecting an appropriate theme from hugo themes list use the example website files that come with a theme (usually themes are hosted in the github and from the github you can grab the corresponding example website files) customize the example website files as required test the website by first building in your computer using hugo server command:  hugo server -D  this spins up the website in the localhost http://localhost:1313/. You can open a browser and go to this localhost and view your website 5. create website html files using the hugo build command:\nhugo -F  or explicitly specify to hugo that the website is ready for production (note: this is required if you link google analytics tag with the website)\nHUGO_ENV=\u0026quot;production\u0026quot; hugo -F  finally, you need to push all the files in public directory to the corresponding github repository that you have created to host the website. You can also specify to hugo if you want to build the html files in directory other than public by adding below to the config.toml file:  publishDir = 'docs'   This blog is also for my reference.\n  Disclaimer: some of the steps may not be efficient!\n Separate hugo website files and generated html files I prefer to keep the generated html files to render the website and the website files that hugo used to generate html files separate. There are two ways to achieve this:\nMethod 1 Host the website files (files that hugo will use to create html files) in one github repo, say WebsiteBase, and host the html files in another repo, say WebsiteStatic.\nThe steps are as follows:\nStep 1 We first create a WebsiteBase containing your example website. Since we don\u0026rsquo;t want to track public directory inside WebsiteBase, we add the following line to .gitignore file:\npublic  Step 2 Next, we go to public directory inside WebsiteBase (public directory is not tracked and public directory will be created when you build the website using hugo -F command). Inside public directory, if this is a first time, create a git repo\n# we assume that we are inside `public` directory git init git add . \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git commit -m \u0026quot;first commit\u0026quot;  Next, suppose you have already created a new repository called WebsiteStatic in github, you can add the remote url to your public directory as follows\n# inside `public` directory git remote add origin https://github.com/\u0026lt;your username\u0026gt;/WebsiteStatic.git  and push the code to github\ngit branch -M main git push origin main # alternatively, if you prefer, you can keep the master as your `main` branch # and push master to the remote # git push origin master  Step 3 Modify the files of WebsiteBase as required and push the changes to WebsiteBase repository. Next, rebuild the website to take the modification in effect using hugo -F command. This will update public directory inside WebsiteBase. You then update the WebsiteStatic as follows:\n# assuming that you are inside `WebsiteBase` repo root directory cd public git add . \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git commit -m \u0026quot;update\u0026quot; # we assume that `public` directory is initialized with `WebsiteStatic` repo (step 2) git push origin main -f  In above we have used flag -f (i.e. force push) because public repository may not have the same files as remote repo WebsiteStatic (this may happen if you use to different computers to update the website). And since we do not care much about the commit history of WebsiteStatic, we simply force push the updates to remote repo.\nOptional - Automate the website update using circle-ci In updating a website, the main part is updating the website files in WebsiteBase (for example, adding new blog, new publication, new project, etc.). After WebsiteBase is updated, the next step is to run hugo to rebuild the website and update the remote repo WebsiteStatic that hosts the html files. This second step can be automated using circle-ci in the github.\nThe idea is that we update the files of WebsiteBase and push the code to github and let circle-ci do the rest. For example, I may want to update the blog file content/blog/modular-website/index.md. Suppose you have modified the files and pushed the updates to WebsiteBase repo in github.\nNext, to trigger circle-ci to do the rest, you first need to create a circle-ci config file inside, i.e., \u0026lt;WebsiteBase root\u0026gt;/.circleci/config.yml, with the instruction to build the website using hugo. For example, my circle-ci config file looks like this:\nversion: 2 jobs: build: docker: - image: klakegg/hugo:0.87.0-ext-ubuntu steps: - run: name: \u0026quot;Run Hugo\u0026quot; command: | apt-get update apt-get install -y git # pull website repo git clone https://github.com/prashjha/my-website.git cd my-website # within this repo, pull html file repo git clone https://github.com/prashjha/prashjha.github.io.git public # build website HUGO_ENV=\u0026quot;production\u0026quot; hugo -F # commit to website repo cd public git config user.email \u0026quot;pjha.sci@gmail.com\u0026quot; git config user.name \u0026quot;Prashant K. Jha\u0026quot; git add . git commit --allow-empty -m \u0026quot;update\u0026quot; # Push quietly to prevent showing the token in log git push -q https://${G_TOKEN}@github.com/prashjha/prashjha.github.io.git main  In above, I use docker image that contains hugo klakegg/hugo:0.87.0-ext-ubuntu. Steps in steps -\u0026gt; run should be obvious. We first clone WebsiteBase (which in my case is named my-website) and then clone the WebsiteStatic (which in my case is name prashjha.github.io) inside public directory. We then build the website using hugo -F command. This updates public directory. We then push the updates to WebsiteStatic.\nSo far you have created config.yml that instructs circle-ci. Next, you need to go to your account in circle-ci. (Create account in circle ci using your github account). Inside circle-ci, you have to add the project WebsiteBase for continuous integration.\n With steps above, everytime you will update WebsiteBase, circle-ci will use the instructions in config.yml and update your WebsiteStatic automatically.\n Method 2 (use submodule) Alternatively, you could store the subset of the website files in a different repository and store the rest of the website files along with the hugo generated html files in one website.\nI opted for this method for the COE 311K course website. I have created a github repo to store the class related files such as lecture notes, assignments, projects, syllabus, etc., see COE 311K. And, I host the website files and the html files in this repo: COE 311K website.\nThe class repo COE 311K contains some of the website files needed to generate the website. For example, syllabus page in the website is based on the markdown file _index.md stored in the syllabus directory of the class repo COE 311K. Similarly, the lecture page of the website is based on the markdown files in the lectures directory of the class repo COE 311K.\nI am outlining the steps I used to create the class website (rough outline) with modular structure explained above:\nStep 1 Except the files which I expect to change often, rest are contained in the website repo COE 311K website. To connect this repo with the class repo COE 311K, we use submodule command. We add repo COE 311K within a repo COE 311K website as follows:\n# assuming inside the root of repo `COE 311K website` git submodule add https://github.com/prashjha/COE-311K.git  Next, I have created a symlink of files in syllabus, lectures, etc. of COE 311K inside the content directory of the repo COE 311K website.\nStep 2 Now that COE 311K website repository has the correct submodule and the symlinks are created to connect the class repository files with the website files, we can build the website using hugo -F.\nIn my case, since I already use prashjha.github.io repository to render my main website, the repository COE 311K website can only be used to render the github pages. And, last time I checked, github pages requires the html files either in the root directory of the repository or the docs directory. Since we do not want to corrupt the root directory of repo by generating html files in the root, the alternative is to ask hugo to generate the html files inside the docs directory. This can be done by adding the line below to the config.toml file:\npublishDir = 'docs'  So, when we run hugo -F, the html files will be generated inside the docs directory.\nWe rebuild the website and push it to the repository. In this case, the website repository will contain all the files (including the html files).\nOptional - Automate the website update using circle-ci Similar to the method 1, we can automate some of the steps. More often modified files are in the class repository COE 311K so when this is updated, we can use the circle-ci to update the class website repository COE 311K website. The circle-ci config file in COE 311K repository looks like:\nversion: 2 jobs: build: docker: - image: klakegg/hugo:0.87.0-ext-ubuntu steps: - run: name: \u0026quot;Run Hugo\u0026quot; command: | apt-get update apt-get install -y git # pull website repo git clone https://github.com/prashjha/COE-311K-website.git cd COE-311K-website # update course repo git submodule update --init COE-311K cd COE-311K git checkout main git pull # build website cd .. hugo -F # commit to website repo git config user.email \u0026quot;pjha.sci@gmail.com\u0026quot; git config user.name \u0026quot;Prashant K. Jha\u0026quot; git add . git commit --allow-empty -m \u0026quot;update\u0026quot; # Push quietly to prevent showing the token in log git push -q https://${G_TOKEN}@github.com/prashjha/COE-311K-website.git main  The steps are more or less similar to method 1 except now that we have submodule inside the website repository and we need to update the submodule before building the code. The submodule is updated in these steps:\ngit submodule update --init COE-311K cd COE-311K git checkout main git pull  We then build the website and update the remote.\n","date":1628208000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628744863,"objectID":"4ab34f291e6f5f979dc4eef50907f647","permalink":"https://prashjha.github.io/blog/modular-website/","publishdate":"2021-08-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/modular-website/","section":"blog","summary":"I am currently using hugo to create website.

Another application of peridynamics recently gaining much attention is in the granular media. DEM based methods can describe the interaction in particulate media very well but cannot model the intra-particle fracture. Prior works have shown the possibility of using peridynamics for the deformation of individual particles and DEM-like laws for the inter-particle interaction.

Additionally, the vascular network, which is changing in both space and time, fundamentally influences tumor response to both systemic and radiation therapy. Thus, a robust understanding of vascular dynamics is necessary to accurately predict tumor growth, as well as establish optimal treatment protocols to achieve optimal tumor control. Such a goal requires the intimate integration of both theory and experiment. Quantitative and time-resolved imaging methods have emerged as technologies able to visualize and characterize tumor vascular properties before and during therapy at the tissue and cell scale. Parallel to, but separate from those developments, mathematical modeling techniques have been developed to enable in silico investigations into theoretical tumor and vascular dynamics. In particular, recent efforts have sought to integrate both theory and experiment to enable data-driven mathematical modeling. Such mathematical models are calibrated by data obtained from individual tumor-vascular systems to predict future vascular growth, delivery of systemic agents, and response to radiotherapy.

We consider a bond-based peridynamics with a nonlinear constitutive law relating the bond-strain to the pairwise force.

One particular topic of interest is the kinetic relation for the crack tip velocity in the peridynamics and its link to the local kinetic relation (LEFM theory). We recover the classical kinetic relation from the peridynamics formulation. We will present numerical results that support the theory. Another application of peridynamics recently gaining much attention is in the granular media. DEM based methods can describe the interaction in particulate media very well but cannot model the intra-particle fracture. Prior works have shown the possibility of using peridynamics for the deformation of individual particles and DEM-like laws for the inter-particle interaction.

In nonlocal models, in contrast to the local model, such as the wave and heat partial differential equations, the material interacts with neighboring points on a larger-length scale compared to the mesh discretization. In developing a fully distributed solver, the interaction over a length scale greater than mesh size introduces additional data dependencies among the compute nodes and communication bottleneck. In this work, we carefully look at these challenges in the context of nonlocal models; to keep the presentation specific to the computational issues, we consider a nonlocal heat equation in a 2d setting. In particular, the distributed framework we propose pays greater attention to the bottleneck of data communication and the dynamic balancing of loads among nodes with varying compute capacity. For load balancing, we propose a novel framework that assesses the compute capacity of nodes and dynamically balances the load so that the idle time among nodes is minimal.

Elucidating particulate media’s behavior in concert with particle attrition (i.e., particle wear and subsequent particle fragmentation) is essential for predicting the performance and increasing the efficiency of engineering systems using such media. Discrete element method (DEM) based techniques can describe the interaction between particles but cannot model intra-particle deformation, especially intra-particle fracture. On the other hand, peridynamics provides the means to account for intra-particle deformation and fracture due to contact forces between particles. The present study proposes a hybrid model referred to as PeriDEM that combines the advantages of peridynamics and DEM. The model parameters can be tuned to achieve desired DEM contact forces, damping effects, and intra-particle stiffness. Two particle impacts and compressive behavior of multi-particle systems are thoroughly investigated. The model can account for any arbitrarily shaped particle in general. Spherical, hexagonal, and non-convex particle shapes are simulated in the present study. The effect of mesh resolution on intra-particle peridynamics is explicitly studied. The proposed hybrid model opens a new avenue to explore the complicated interactions encountered in discrete particle dynamics that involve the formation of force chains, particle interlocking, particle attrition, wear, and the eventual breakage.","tags":null,"title":"Peridynamics-based discrete element method (PeriDEM) model of granular systems involving breakage of arbitrarily shaped particles","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1602201600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628297933,"objectID":"fdf3712bb53ef8fb099b0659c3d2aa8e","permalink":"https://prashjha.github.io/talk/seminar-cmu-2020/","publishdate":"2020-10-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/seminar-cmu-2020/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A mechanistic tumor growth model for HP MRI","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1600214400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628297933,"objectID":"3082d0dc67b88e7e59180eff122e97d6","permalink":"https://prashjha.github.io/talk/seminar-utaustin-2020/","publishdate":"2020-09-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/seminar-utaustin-2020/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A mechanistic tumor growth model for HP MRI","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Develop efficient and parallel computational methods for class of nonlocal models such as Peridynamics and nonlocal diffusion equations\nActivities 1.

A priori error analysis and well-posedness of nonlinear peridynamic models At Louisiana State University, I had spent a good amount of time working on a priori error estimates for finite-difference and finite-element discretization of and well-posedness of nonlinear peridynamic models. This was under the guidance of my adviser Dr. R. Lipton. On this topic, we have published several journal articles and few book chapters, see publication page.\nWe know that peridynamics regularizes the discontinuity; the sharp edge of discontinuity is replaced with the softening zone containing material points with large strains (classical strain). Away from the softening zone, the strains are smaller. Typically the size of the softening zone is proportional to the nonlocal length scale. As the nonlocal length scale goes to zero, the softening zone localizes to a sharp crack. To demonstrate this, we consider a setup shown in Figure 1. In Figure 2, we plot the damage for three different nonlocal length scales at two times. We see that for a smaller nonlocal length scale, the softening zone indicated by the red region is smaller than that of a bigger nonlocal length scale. In Figure 3, we put the plots of three horizons on top of each other, and we see the localization of the softening zone.\n         Figure 1: Setup for localization of softening zone. More details preprint, section 6 Figure 2: Damage in material with three horizons at two times.            Figure 3: Softening zone of three horizons when placed on top of each other. Light yellow, light orange, and red correspond to smaller, intermediate, and larger horizons. As the horizon is getting smaller softening zone is shrinking to a very thin region, and ultimately in the limit, it will tend to sharp crack.    3. Model development In this article, we proposed a bond-based peridynamic model with memory effect. If the material is subjected to cyclic loading, with each cycle deforming the material beyond some critical strain, it will continue to lose stiffness in every loading cycle. This effect is simulated using the temporal nonlocal force (material strength at a current time depends on the history) in the proposed model.\n","date":1595030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628297933,"objectID":"fb071828d56dfff31f2912e321386ace","permalink":"https://prashjha.github.io/project/fracture-mechanics/","publishdate":"2020-07-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fracture-mechanics/","section":"project","summary":"Analysis and application of peridynamics","tags":["peridynamics","nonlocal","fracture mechanics","computational mechanics"],"title":"Analysis and application of peridynamics","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Activities 1.

Towards this, we are working with experts at the Center for Computational Oncology for the application of the multi-dimensional model to breast cancer. The vasculature, flow parameters, initial tumor region in our model will be based on MRI data.\nIt is known that the vessels formed as a result of angiogenesis are leaky and weak; the mechanical forces in the tissue microenvironment plays are role in the modification and destruction of these vessels. The mechanical effects are also observed in the growth of the tumor.

A mechanistic tumor growth model for HP MRI The goals of this project are two-fold; 1) optimal experimental design for Hyperpolarized (HP) MRI formulation to obtain the optimal MRI scan parameters such that the information content of the data about the parameter of interest is increased, and 2) the development of PDE-based high-fidelity model for HP-MRI. Hyperpolarized (HP) 13C-Pyruvate MR imaging provides unique information about metabolic alterations indicative of the aggressiveness of certain cancer types. The information content of the HP-MRI data is fundamentally limited by the physics and chemistry of specific processes that take place at an atomic scale during a well-defined chemical reaction. The HP signal (magnetization of pyruvate and lactate) is a fixed resource established at the polarizer, naturally decays over time, and cannot be renewed after injection. The signal is further reduced with every radio-frequency excitation by the MR pulse sequence. A key parameter of interest recovered from HP-MRI measurements is the apparent pyruvate-to-lactate exchange rate, kPL, for measuring tumor metabolism. One of the key goals of this project is to formulate an Optimal Experimental Design (OED) problem to determine the MRI scan parameters that lead to data with increased information about the parameter of interest. The second goal of this project is to develop a high-fidelity model for HP-MRI. The high-fidelity model, if carefully constructed, can be closer to reality than existing pharmacokinetic models, which are spatially invariant. Further, using such high-fidelity models in the OED problem can lead to better MRI design parameters.\nIn Fall 2020, Oden Institute, MD Anderson Cancer Center, and TACC signed an MOU to advance cancer research.

Extension of DEM based method to overcome these challenges is possible. However, it is not trivial. PeriDEM model proposed in Jha et al 2021 uses peridynamics for deformation of individual particles. In the model, the contact forces between two particles act at the level of discretization. Because contact forces are applied to discretized nodes (within a small distance) of two particles, particles can see the local boundary; thus, the model can accurately simulate the locking effects.\n        Figure 1: Two-particle test. The top particle is given initial velocity. The plot shows the damage upon contact for different initial velocities—both particles made of the same materials. Damage above 1 indicates the onset of failure. From Jha et al 2021            Figure 2: Same as Figure 1, but now the particle on top is stronger than the bottom particle. We see that only the bottom particle has damage above 1.            Figure 3: Compressive test using 502 circular and hexagon-shaped particles of varying sizes.

Through this shift of increasing cores per node, a new programming model with focus on handling of the fine-grain parallelism with increasing amount of cores per computational node is needed. Asynchronous Many Task (AMT) run time systems represent a paradigm for addressing the fine-grain parallelism. They handle the increasing amount of threads per node and concurrency. HPX, a open source C++ standard library for parallelism and concurrency, is one AMT which is conforming to the C++ standard. Motivated by the impressive performance of asynchronous task-based parallelism through HPX to N-body problem and astrophysics simulation, in this work, we consider its application to the Peridynamics theory. Peridynamics is a non-local generalization of continuum mechanics tailored to address discontinuous displacement fields arising in fracture mechanics. Peridynamics requires considerable computing resources, owing to its non-local nature of formulation, offering a scope for improved computing performance via asynchronous task-based parallelism. Our results show that HPX-based peridynamic computation is scalable, and the scalability is in agreement with the theory. In addition to the scalability, we also show the validation results and the mesh convergence results. For the validation, we consider implicit time integration and compare the result with the classical continuum mechanics (CCM) (peridynamics under small deformation should give similar results as CCM). For the mesh convergence, we consider explicit time integration and show that the results are in agreement with theoretical claims in previous works.","tags":null,"title":"An asynchronous and task-based implementation of peridynamics utilizing HPX—the C++ standard library for parallelism and concurrency","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538784000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628297933,"objectID":"465311852f24af69602c35f86d4678d6","permalink":"https://prashjha.github.io/talk/conference-siam-la-tx-2018/","publishdate":"2018-10-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/conference-siam-la-tx-2018/","section":"talk","summary":"We consider a nonlocal fracture model and study the convergence properties of the finite element and the finite difference approximation.

The potential associated with the model has two wells where one well corresponds to linear elastic behavior and the other corresponds to brittle fracture (see Lipton (J Elast 117(1):21--50, 2014; 124(2):143--191, 2016)). The parameters in the potential can be directly related to the elastic tensor and fracture toughness. In this chapter we show that well-posed formulations of the model can be developed over different function spaces. Here we will consider formulations posed over Hölder spaces and Sobolev spaces. The motivation for the Hölder space formulation is to show a priori convergence for the discrete finite difference method. The motivation for the Sobolev formulation is to show a priori convergence for the finite element method. In the following chapter we will show that the discrete approximations converge to well-posed evolutions. The associated convergence rates are given explicitly in terms of time step and the size of the spatial mesh.","tags":null,"title":"Well-Posed Nonlinear Nonlocal Fracture Models Associated with Double-Well Potentials","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Prashant K Jha","Robert Lipton"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1523318400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628297933,"objectID":"b02752e981ec961916e75726555ba09c","permalink":"https://prashjha.github.io/publication/jha-2018-numerical/","publishdate":"2018-04-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jha-2018-numerical/","section":"publication","summary":"In this work, we calculate the convergence rate of the finite difference approximation for a class of nonlocal fracture models.

We begin by giving a brief introduction to the Peridynamic theory and the nonlocal potentials considered in our work. We consider a force interaction characterized by a double well potential. Here, one well, near zero strain, corresponds to the linear response of a material, and the other well, for large strain, corresponds to the softening of a material. We show the existence of a regularized model with evolving displacement field in either Hölder space or Sobolev space. Assuming exact solutions in Hölder space, we obtain apriori error estimates due to finite difference approximation. We show that the error converges to zero, uniformly in time, in the mean square norm. The rate depends on the nonlocal length scale and is proportional to O(Delta t + h^gamma / epsilon^2). Here h is the size of mesh, epsilon is the nonlocal length scale, Delta t is the size of time step, and gamma in (0,1] is the Hölder exponent. C is the constant independent of mesh size and size of time step and may depend on nonlocal length scale through the norm of the exact solution. We also study the finite element approximation and show that the error uniformly converges to zero at the rate O(Delta t + h^2/epsilon^2). We consider piecewise linear continuous elements.

We work within the small deformation setting, and the model is developed within a state-based peridynamic formulation. At each instant of the evolution, we identify the softening zone where strains lie above the strength of the material. We show that deformation discontinuities associated with flaws larger than the length scale of nonlocality $δ$ can become unstable and grow. An explicit inequality is found that shows that the volume of the softening zone goes to zero linearly with the length scale of nonlocal interaction. This scaling is consistent with the notion that a softening zone of width proportional to $δ$ converges to a sharp fracture set as the length scale of nonlocal interaction goes to zero. Here the softening zone is interpreted as a regularization of the crack network. Inside quiescent regions with no cracks or softening, the nonlocal operator converges to the local elastic operator at a rate proportional to the radius of nonlocal interaction. This model is designed to be calibrated to measured values of critical energy release rate, shear modulus, and bulk modulus of material samples. For this model one is not restricted to Poisson ratios of 1/4 and can choose the potentials so that small strain behavior is specified by the isotropic elasticity tensor for any material with prescribed shear and Lamé moduli.","tags":null,"title":"Dynamic Brittle Fracture from Nonlocal Double-Well Potentials: A State-Based Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1500422400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628297933,"objectID":"a2de0655481f07873448cfc6fca7aff4","permalink":"https://prashjha.github.io/talk/conference-usnccm-14-2017/","publishdate":"2017-07-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/conference-usnccm-14-2017/","section":"talk","summary":"In this work, we present the numerical analysis of a bond-based peridynamic model.
