Goal-Oriented A-Posteriori Estimation of Model Error as an Aid to Parameter Estimation (with Dr. Oden) We consider the problem of estimating modeling error in boundary – and initial–value problems characterized by partial differential equations (PDEs), with the understanding that the purpose of the prediction, the ultimate goal of the simulation, is to compute specific quantities of interest: the “QoIs”. Mathematically the QoIs are functionals of solutions to the so-called primal or forward problem. We review the theory of goal-oriented a-posteriori estimation of modeling error “Oden and Prudhomme, JCP 182.2 (2002): 496-515”. Here we add to this theory a new ingredient: we explore the question of can such a-posterior estimates of error between a high-fidelity model of a physical system in which parameters are not known with precision, and a surrogate, low-fidelity models with known parameters, be used to infer properties and parameters of the high-fidelity system? We developed a Bayesian framework for studying such issues based on goal-oriented QoI-error estimates, and we give examples in which this approach is very successful.\nThis work is published in JCP and can be found in this link: Jha and Oden (2022).\n2. Residual-based error correction for neural operator accelerated infinite-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems (with Lianghao, Thomas, Dr. Oden, and Omar) We explore using neural operators, or neural network representations of nonlinear maps between function spaces, to accelerate infinite-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems (BIPs) with models governed by nonlinear parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). The computational cost of BIPs can be drastically reduced if the large number of PDE solves required for posterior characterization are replaced with evaluations of trained neural operators. However, reducing error in the resulting BIP solutions via reducing the approximation error of the neural operators in training can be challenging and unreliable. To reliably deploy neural operators in BIPs, we consider a strategy for enhancing the performance of neural operators: correcting the prediction of a trained neural operator by solving a linear variational problem based on the PDE residual. We show that a trained neural operator with error correction can achieve a quadratic reduction of its approximation error, all while retaining substantial computational speedups of posterior sampling when models are governed by highly nonlinear PDEs. The strategy is applied to two numerical examples of BIPs based on a nonlinear reaction–diffusion problem and deformation of hyperelastic materials.\nThis work is published in JCP and can be found in this link: Cao et al.

This can be rationalized by noticing that the decay of the dipole kernel is sufficiently fast when the lattice sums run over one and two dimensions, and is also consistent with prior work on dimension reduction of continuum micromagnetic bodies to the thin film limit. However, an interesting contrast between the discrete-to-continuum approach and the continuum dimension reduction approaches is that the limit energy in the latter depends only on the normal component of the dipole field, whereas in the discrete-to-continuum approach, both tangential and normal components of the dipole field contribute to the limit energy.","tags":["Continuum Limit","Nanostructures","Electrostatics","Dipole-Dipole Interaction","Multiscale Methods"],"title":"Discrete-to-Continuum Limits of Long-Range Electrical Interactions in Nanostructures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lianghao Cao","Thomas O'Leary-Roseberry","Prashant K.

The overall strategy is posed in the framework of the Quasicontinuum multiscale method; specifically, the use of a finite-element inspired kinematic description enables a significant reduction in the large number of degrees of freedom to describe the atomic positions. The key advance of this work is a method for the efficient and accurate treatment of nonlocal electrostatic charge-charge interactions without restrictions on the geometry or boundary conditions. Electrostatic interactions are long-range with slow decay, and hence require consideration of all pairs of charges making a brute-force approach computationally prohibitive. The method proposed here accounts for the exact charge-charge interactions in the near-field and uses a coarse-grained approximation in the far-field. The coarse-grained approximation and the associated errors are rigorously derived based on the limit of a finite body with a small periodic lengthscale, thereby enabling the errors in the approximation to be controlled to a desired tolerance. The method is applied to a simple model of Gallium Nitride and it is shown that electrostatic interactions can be approximated with a desired level of accuracy using the proposed methodology.","tags":["Multiscale Modeling","Ionic Solids","Electrostatics","Quasicontinuum Method"],"title":"Atomic-to-Continuum Multiscale Modeling of Defects in Crystals with Nonlocal Electrostatic Interactions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Prashant K Jha","Christopher Walker","Drew Mitchell","J.

The information content of the HP-MRI data is fundamentally limited by the physics and chemistry of specific processes that take place at an atomic scale during a well-defined chemical reaction. The HP signal (magnetization of pyruvate and lactate) is a fixed resource that is established at the polarizer and naturally decays over time, and cannot be renewed after injection. The signal is further reduced with every radio-frequency excitation by the MR pulse sequence. Therefore, optimal experimental design (OED) for data acquisition is fundamentally important. A key parameter of interest recovered from HP-MRI measurements is the apparent pyruvate-to-lactate exchange rate, kPL, for measuring tumor metabolism. This manuscript presents an information-theory-based OED approach that minimizes the uncertainty in the rate parameter, kPL, recovered from the HP-MRI measurements.\n\nResults suggest that the mutual information-based optimal data acquisition strategy is likely to improve the precision of the measurements. For the particular MRI data examined here, pyruvate and lactate flip angles of 35 and 28 degrees, respectively, were the best choice in terms of accuracy and precision of the parameter recovery. Moreover, the recovery of rate parameter kPL from the data generated from the high-fidelity model highlights the influence of diffusion and strength of vascular source on the recovered rate parameter. Since the existing pharmacokinetic models for HP-MRI do not account for spatial variation, the optimized design parameters may not be fully optimal in a more general 3D setting.","tags":["Computational Modeling","Optimal Experimental Design","Mutual Information","Uncertainty Quantification","Pharmacokinetic Models","Partial Differential Equations"],"title":"Mutual-Information Based Optimal Experimental Design for Hyperpolarized 13C-Pyruvate MRI","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Track: Mechanics of Solids, Structures and Fluids\n  Topic 12-21: Data-Enabled Predictive Modeling, Machine Learning, and Uncertainty Quantification in Computational Mechanics\n ","date":1635724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628297933,"objectID":"304e13ecfe442029e2a901d8c86191fc","permalink":"https://prashjha.github.io/talk/conference-imece-2021/","publishdate":"2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/conference-imece-2021/","section":"talk","summary":"Hyperpolarized (HP) MR imaging provides enhanced insights into the tissue's metabolism and a new way to identify the tumor colony. In HP MRI, MR visible HP pyruvate is injected into the patient. It is observed that the cancerous cells promote higher production of lactate from pyruvate through Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) compared to healthy cells; since the pyruvate is polarized, the product lactate is also polarized and visible in the MR scan. Therefore, the HP MRI experiment allows one to see HP pyruvate's distribution and the byproduct such as lactate. Higher conversion of pyruvate to lactate in the tissue may indicate the presence of an active tumor colony. Hence, the pyruvate-to-lactate conversion rate is a parameter of interest and must be inferred from the HP MR scan data. Mathematical models are required to recover the pyruvate-to-lactate conversion rate; the model needs to account for the natural decay of polarization in pyruvate and lactate, loss of polarization due to the interaction of MR signal and polarization, transient nature of vascular input of polarized pyruvate, and also the presence of endogenous pyruvate and lactate in the tissue. Additionally, the parameter's inference should also account for the signal-to-noise ratio and other uncertainties such as bolus arrival time. Unlike traditional MR, where the source does not change as many times the scan is taken, in HP MRI, there is polarization loss in every scan. This loss depends on the choice of flip angles and repetition times. There are two significant challenges associated with the HP MR experiment: 1) selecting the most plausible model among multiple models for the given data, 2) optimizing MR parameters such as repetition times and flip angles for the most accurate inference of pyruvate-to-lactate conversion rate. In this work, we apply the OPAL (the Occam Plausibility Algorithm) model selection method to find the most plausible model for the given data. For the second challenge, we consider the Bayesian-based optimal experimental design (OED); here, we formulate the mutual information for the design parameters taking the total signal as the data and ask for design parameters that maximize the mutual information. Our results show that the optimal parameters such as repetition time and flip angles are different from what is considered typically in the experiments. We also show that with optimal design parameters, the variation in pyruvate-to-lactate conversion rate is smaller. Future works include developing high-fidelity spatially varying models with explicit vessel-tissue flow coupling and the formulation of optimal experimental design using high-fidelity models.","tags":null,"title":"Model selection and optimal experiment design for HP MRI experiments","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"With colleagues, Ernesto Lima and Chengyue Wu, at Oden Institute, we are organizing a virtual thematic conference on computational oncology.

We consider a bond-based peridynamics with a nonlinear constitutive law relating the bond-strain to the pairwise force. For the model considered, we can show well-posedness and existence in the Hölder and Hilbert H2 space under appropriate conditions and obtain apriori bounds on the finite-difference and finite-element discretization. We will present the application of the model to mode-I and mixed-mode fracture problems. One particular topic of interest is the kinetic relation for the crack tip velocity in the peridynamics and its link to the local kinetic relation (LEFM theory).

Additionally, the model includes ECM erosion, interstitial flow, and coupled flow in vessels and tissue. We employ continuum mixture theory with stochastic Cahn–Hilliard type phase-field models of tumor growth. The interstitial flow is governed by a mesoscale version of Darcy’s law. The flow in the blood vessels is controlled by Poiseuille flow, and Starling’s law is applied to model the mass transfer in and out of blood vessels. The evolution of the network of blood vessels is orchestrated by the concentration of the tumor angiogenesis factor (TAF) by growing towards increasing TAF concentration. The process is not deterministic, allowing random growth of blood vessels and, therefore, due to the coupling of nutrients in tissue and vessels, stochastic tumor growth. We demonstrate the performance of the model by applying it to a variety of scenarios. Numerical experiments illustrate the flexibility of the model and its ability to generate satellite tumors. Simulations of the effects of angiogenesis on tumor growth are presented as well as sample-independent features of cancer. This is joint work with Dr. J. T.

In nonlocal models, in contrast to the local model, such as the wave and heat partial differential equations, the material interacts with neighboring points on a larger-length scale compared to the mesh discretization. In developing a fully distributed solver, the interaction over a length scale greater than mesh size introduces additional data dependencies among the compute nodes and communication bottleneck. In this work, we carefully look at these challenges in the context of nonlocal models; to keep the presentation specific to the computational issues, we consider a nonlocal heat equation in a 2d setting. In particular, the distributed framework we propose pays greater attention to the bottleneck of data communication and the dynamic balancing of loads among nodes with varying compute capacity. For load balancing, we propose a novel framework that assesses the compute capacity of nodes and dynamically balances the load so that the idle time among nodes is minimal. Our framework relies heavily on HPX library, an asynchronous many-task run time system. We present several results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","tags":["Computational Science","Algorithms","Software","Parallel Computing"],"title":"Load Balancing for Distributed Nonlocal Models Within Asynchronous Many-Task Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David A.

Additionally, the vascular network, which is changing in both space and time, fundamentally influences tumor response to both systemic and radiation therapy. Thus, a robust understanding of vascular dynamics is necessary to accurately predict tumor growth, as well as establish optimal treatment protocols to achieve optimal tumor control. Such a goal requires the intimate integration of both theory and experiment. Quantitative and time-resolved imaging methods have emerged as technologies able to visualize and characterize tumor vascular properties before and during therapy at the tissue and cell scale. Parallel to, but separate from those developments, mathematical modeling techniques have been developed to enable in silico investigations into theoretical tumor and vascular dynamics. In particular, recent efforts have sought to integrate both theory and experiment to enable data-driven mathematical modeling. Such mathematical models are calibrated by data obtained from individual tumor-vascular systems to predict future vascular growth, delivery of systemic agents, and response to radiotherapy. In this review, we discuss experimental techniques for visualizing and quantifying vascular dynamics including magnetic resonance imaging, microfluidic devices, and confocal microscopy. We then focus on the integration of these experimental measures with biologically based mathematical models to generate testable predictions.","tags":["Computational Oncology","Tumor Growth Modeling","Angiogenesis","Computational Science"],"title":"Biologically-Based Mathematical Modeling of Tumor Vasculature and Angiogenesis via Time-Resolved Imaging Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Code information Github link: Angiogenesis3D1D\nDocumentation:\n  Readme  Developers:\n Prashant K.

Elucidating particulate media’s behavior in concert with particle attrition (i.e., particle wear and subsequent particle fragmentation) is essential for predicting the performance and increasing the efficiency of engineering systems using such media. Discrete element method (DEM) based techniques can describe the interaction between particles but cannot model intra-particle deformation, especially intra-particle fracture. On the other hand, peridynamics provides the means to account for intra-particle deformation and fracture due to contact forces between particles. The present study proposes a hybrid model referred to as PeriDEM that combines the advantages of peridynamics and DEM. The model parameters can be tuned to achieve desired DEM contact forces, damping effects, and intra-particle stiffness. Two particle impacts and compressive behavior of multi-particle systems are thoroughly investigated. The model can account for any arbitrarily shaped particle in general. Spherical, hexagonal, and non-convex particle shapes are simulated in the present study. The effect of mesh resolution on intra-particle peridynamics is explicitly studied. The proposed hybrid model opens a new avenue to explore the complicated interactions encountered in discrete particle dynamics that involve the formation of force chains, particle interlocking, particle attrition, wear, and the eventual breakage.","tags":["Granular Media Mechanics","Mechanics","Peridynamics","Fracture Mechanics","Particle Breakage","Particle Interlocking","Deformable Particles"],"title":"Peridynamics-Based Discrete Element Method (PeriDEM) Model of Granular Systems Involving Breakage of Arbitrarily Shaped Particles","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  Youtube link to the presentation.\n ","date":1621900800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628297933,"objectID":"34e9737984e3fe43d7950039e8693055","permalink":"https://prashjha.github.io/talk/conference-emi-pmc-2021/","publishdate":"2021-05-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/conference-emi-pmc-2021/","section":"talk","summary":"In this talk, we will present our recent work on peridynamics and its application.

Through this shift of increasing cores per node, a new programming model with focus on handling of the fine-grain parallelism with increasing amount of cores per computational node is needed. Asynchronous Many Task (AMT) run time systems represent a paradigm for addressing the fine-grain parallelism. They handle the increasing amount of threads per node and concurrency. HPX, a open source C++ standard library for parallelism and concurrency, is one AMT which is conforming to the C++ standard. Motivated by the impressive performance of asynchronous task-based parallelism through HPX to N-body problem and astrophysics simulation, in this work, we consider its application to the Peridynamics theory. Peridynamics is a non-local generalization of continuum mechanics tailored to address discontinuous displacement fields arising in fracture mechanics. Peridynamics requires considerable computing resources, owing to its non-local nature of formulation, offering a scope for improved computing performance via asynchronous task-based parallelism. Our results show that HPX-based peridynamic computation is scalable, and the scalability is in agreement with the theory. In addition to the scalability, we also show the validation results and the mesh convergence results. For the validation, we consider implicit time integration and compare the result with the classical continuum mechanics (CCM) (peridynamics under small deformation should give similar results as CCM). For the mesh convergence, we consider explicit time integration and show that the results are in agreement with theoretical claims in previous works.","tags":["Peridynamics","Fracture Mechanics","Software","Computational Science"],"title":"An Asynchronous and Task-Based Implementation of Peridynamics Utilizing HPX—the C++ Standard Library for Parallelism and Concurrency","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Prashant K Jha","Lianghao Cao","J Tinsley Oden"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687501845,"objectID":"b61c7b1deebacd0f86341edd50a19c20","permalink":"https://prashjha.github.io/publication/jha-2020-seird/","publishdate":"2020-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jha-2020-seird/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider a mixture-theoretic continuum model of the spread of COVID-19 in Texas.

A priori error analysis and well-posedness of nonlinear peridynamic models At Louisiana State University, I had spent a good amount of time working on a priori error estimates for finite-difference and finite-element discretization of and well-posedness of nonlinear peridynamic models. This was under the guidance of my adviser Dr. R. Lipton. On this topic, we have published several journal articles and few book chapters, see publication page.\nWe know that peridynamics regularizes the discontinuity; the sharp edge of discontinuity is replaced with the softening zone containing material points with large strains (classical strain). Away from the softening zone, the strains are smaller. Typically the size of the softening zone is proportional to the nonlocal length scale. As the nonlocal length scale goes to zero, the softening zone localizes to a sharp crack. To demonstrate this, we consider a setup shown in Figure 1. In Figure 2, we plot the damage for three different nonlocal length scales at two times. We see that for a smaller nonlocal length scale, the softening zone indicated by the red region is smaller than that of a bigger nonlocal length scale. In Figure 3, we put the plots of three horizons on top of each other, and we see the localization of the softening zone.\n         Figure 1: Setup for localization of softening zone. More details preprint, section 6 Figure 2: Damage in material with three horizons at two times.            Figure 3: Softening zone of three horizons when placed on top of each other. Light yellow, light orange, and red correspond to smaller, intermediate, and larger horizons. As the horizon is getting smaller softening zone is shrinking to a very thin region, and ultimately in the limit, it will tend to sharp crack.    3. Model development In this article, we proposed a bond-based peridynamic model with memory effect. If the material is subjected to cyclic loading, with each cycle deforming the material beyond some critical strain, it will continue to lose stiffness in every loading cycle. This effect is simulated using the temporal nonlocal force (material strength at a current time depends on the history) in the proposed model.\n","date":1595030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687501845,"objectID":"fb071828d56dfff31f2912e321386ace","permalink":"https://prashjha.github.io/project/fracture-mechanics/","publishdate":"2020-07-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fracture-mechanics/","section":"project","summary":"Analysis and application of peridynamics","tags":["peridynamics","nonlocal","fracture mechanics","computational mechanics","mechanics"],"title":"Analysis and application of peridynamics","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Activities 1. Analysis of a new multispecies tumor growth model coupling 3D phase-fields with a 1D vascular network This is joint work with Dr. J. T. Oden at UT Austin and colleagues at the Technical University of Munich. In this work, we study the 3D-1D model of tumor growth that couples the flow and transport of nutrients in the vessel network with nutrient and tumor evolution in the tissue domain. In particular, we looked at the well-posedness of the resulting highly coupled multi-dimension nonlinear model. See the article.\nFigure 1 below shows progression of tumor towards nutrient rich artery on the right.

Modeling and simulation of vascular tumors embedded in dynamically evolving capillary networks This work takes the work in the paper above one step further. In this work, we add the angiogenesis effect to the model. Angiogenesis is a phenomenon through which nutrient-starved tumor cells release unique molecules collectively called TAF (Tumor Angiogenesis Factor), which co-opt the blood vessels in the vicinity to grow towards the tumor colony and supply nutrients. We recently submitted the work for review, see article.\nFigure 2 demonstrates the angiogenesis effect and simultaneous tumor growth.

Application and extension of the 3D-1D model of tumor growth Next, we are interested in developing a tumor growth model to predict treatment responses and metastasis. For both of these problems, it is necessary to model the coupled flow in tissue and vasculature. We are extending the model to include the flow of drugs in vessels and tissue and its effect on tumor growth.\nWhile our work so far has been concerned with algorithmic development and abstract simulations that highlight the key capabilities of the model, we are also interested in the model\u0026rsquo;s calibration using MRI data. Towards this, we are working with experts at the Center for Computational Oncology for the application of the multi-dimensional model to breast cancer. The vasculature, flow parameters, initial tumor region in our model will be based on MRI data.\nIt is known that the vessels formed as a result of angiogenesis are leaky and weak; the mechanical forces in the tissue microenvironment plays are role in the modification and destruction of these vessels. The mechanical effects are also observed in the growth of the tumor. We are also interested in adding a mechanical component to the model and coupling the mechanical forces with vessels' displacement and tumor growth.\n","date":1595030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628297933,"objectID":"14373fbd2c5edb2a4810f4c978554ce4","permalink":"https://prashjha.github.io/project/tumor-modeling/","publishdate":"2020-07-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/tumor-modeling/","section":"project","summary":"Development and analysis of models of tumor growth, angiogenesis, drug therapy, and metastasis","tags":["tumor model","angiogenesis","continuum modeling","computational oncology","multiphysics modeling"],"title":"Modeling tumor growth, angiogenesis, drug-therapy, metastasis","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Activities 1. Development of a high-fidelity model for granular media Taking the earlier research on peridynamics for granular media forward, we have developed the Peridynamics-DEM high-fidelity model that can handle arbitrarily shaped particles and particle breakage. Traditional models based on DEM (Discrete Element Method) can not handle the particles with arbitrary shapes and deformation of individual particles. Extension of DEM based method to overcome these challenges is possible. However, it is not trivial. PeriDEM model proposed in Jha et al 2021 uses peridynamics for deformation of individual particles. In the model, the contact forces between two particles act at the level of discretization. Because contact forces are applied to discretized nodes (within a small distance) of two particles, particles can see the local boundary; thus, the model can accurately simulate the locking effects.\n        Figure 1: Two-particle test.

We consider state-based peridynamic models where the force at a material point is due to both the strain between two points and the change in volume inside the domain of the nonlocal interaction. The pairwise interactions between points are mediated by a bond potential of multi-well type while multi-point interactions are associated with the volume change mediated by a hydrostatic strain potential. The hydrostatic potential can either be a quadratic function, delivering a linear force–strain relation, or a multi-well type that can be associated with the material degradation and cavitation. We first show the well-posedness of the peridynamic formulation and that peridynamic evolutions exist in the Sobolev space $H^2$. We show that the finite element approximations converge to the $H^2$ solutions uniformly as measured in the mean square norm. For linear continuous finite elements, the convergence rate is shown to be $C_t \\Delta t + C_s h^2∕\\epsilon^2$, where $\\epsilon$ is the size of the horizon, $h$ is the mesh size, and $\\Delta t$ is the size of the time step. The constants $C_t$ and $C_s$ are independent of $\\Delta t$ and $h$ and may depend on $\\epsilon$ through the norm of the exact solution. We demonstrate the stability of the semi-discrete approximation. The stability of the fully discrete approximation is shown for the linearized peridynamic force.

We show that deformation discontinuities associated with flaws larger than the length scale of nonlocality $δ$ can become unstable and grow. An explicit inequality is found that shows that the volume of the softening zone goes to zero linearly with the length scale of nonlocal interaction. This scaling is consistent with the notion that a softening zone of width proportional to $δ$ converges to a sharp fracture set as the length scale of nonlocal interaction goes to zero. Here the softening zone is interpreted as a regularization of the crack network. Inside quiescent regions with no cracks or softening, the nonlocal operator converges to the local elastic operator at a rate proportional to the radius of nonlocal interaction. This model is designed to be calibrated to measured values of critical energy release rate, shear modulus, and bulk modulus of material samples. For this model one is not restricted to Poisson ratios of 1/4 and can choose the potentials so that small strain behavior is specified by the isotropic elasticity tensor for any material with prescribed shear and Lamé moduli.","tags":["Mathematical Modeling","Mechanics","Peridynamics","Fracture Mechanics"],"title":"Dynamic Brittle Fracture from Nonlocal Double-Well Potentials: A State-Based Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Lipton","Eyad Said","Prashant K Jha"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1547164800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663575759,"objectID":"1b4557797b9872b0d9a1b78921580240","permalink":"https://prashjha.github.io/publication/lipton-2018-book-memory/","publishdate":"2019-01-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lipton-2018-book-memory/","section":"publication","summary":"A model for dynamic damage propagation is developed using nonlocal potentials.

More generally, for local Lagrange interpolation of order $p\\geq 1$, the consistency error is of order $hp∕\\epsilon$. A new stability theory for the time discretization is provided and an explicit generalization of the CFL condition on the time step and its relation to mesh size $h$ is given.

We use max-ent method presented in [Kulkarni et al., 2008] to formulate the problem as a minimization problem with respect to the atomic position and the atomic momenta. For the electrical interactions in the multi- scale method, we use the continuum limit of the energy for the random charge density field.
