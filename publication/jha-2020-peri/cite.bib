 abstract = {A simple nonlocal field theory of peridynamic type is applied to model brittle fracture. The kinetic relation for the crack tip velocity given by Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) is recovered directly from the nonlocal dynamics, this is seen both theoretically and in simulations. An explicit formula for the change of internal energy inside a neighborhood enclosing the crack tip is found for the nonlocal model and applied to LEFM.}
